			<h1>Lab 3 - File Structure and File Transfer</h1>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Big Idea</h2>
					<p>The goal of this lab was to create a local file structure and add index.html files.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenges</h2>
					<p>So far, I haven't had any problems working in HTML and CSS. My biggest challenge was trying to find colors
						that worked for my homepage.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>I made a new homepage from scratch, using the old one as a guide. The page you're currently looking at was
						modified from a template, though.</p>
					<div id="output">
						<img src="./img/ART101_Lab3_file_struct.png" alt="My file structure">
