                <h2>Challenge</h2>
                <p>The goal of this lab is to experiment with jQuery and create a program that changes elements on a page by toggling
                    classes on elements. The biggest challenge was setting up the jQuery.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="special-section">
                <h2>Problems</h2>
                <p>My main problem was that the buttons weren't toggling the special class when I attempted Task X. I observed the
                    console, but nothing happened when I clicked the buttons. I realized that I was still appending the buttons
                    with the button-challenge id, and I came to the conclusion that having multiple elements with the same id was
                    causing problems. Sure enough, when I removed the id, everything worked fine!</p>
            </div>

            <div class="special-section">
                <h2>Results</h2>
                <p>In each section, there's a button labeled "Make Special." Click them and see what happens.</p>
