			<h1>Lab 4 - Pseudocoding and Problem-solving</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The goal was to write out a common task and the actions of a game in pseudocode.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Our biggest concern was coming up with what task and game to write our pseudocode for. Aside from that, we had
						no problems with the lab itself.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<div id="output">
						<h3>Pseudocode for an Everyday Task</h3>
						<p>Changing an internal laptop battery:</p>
						<ol>
							<li>Turn off the laptop</li>
							<li>Set the laptop on a clean surface</li>
							<li>Flip over the laptop so that the bottom is exposed</li>
							<li>Remove the bottom cover of the laptop (this can be held in the form of screws/latches)</li>
							<li>Disconnect the battery’s power connector from the system board</li>
							<li>Remove the battery and replace it with a new model (the battery may also be held in by screws or latches)</li>
							<li>Put the bottom cover of the laptop back on</li>
						</ol>
						<h3>Pseudocode for a simple computer game</h3>
						<p>Connect 4</p>
						<ol>
							<li>Print a 6x7 slot board</li>
							<li>Accept user input for each column</li>
							<li>Validate user move (if they are able to commit the move)</li>
							<li>Move player's input piece to lowest empty space in the column</li>
							<li>Evaluate possible moves for computer</li>
							<li>Choose computer move</li>
							<li>Move computer's piece to lowest empty space in the column</li>
							<li>Confirm the winner when 4 pieces make a row, column, or diagonal</li>
						</ol>
						<h3>Pseudocode as comments</h3>
						<pre><code>
	// Print a 6x7  slot board
	// Accept user input for each column
		// Validate user move (if they are able to commit the move)
		// Move player’s input piece to lowest empty space in the column
		// Print board with player's move added
	// Evaluate possible moves for computer
		// Loop through each column to determine the best valid move
		// Choose computer move
		// Move computer’s piece to lowest empty space in the column  
		// Print board with computer's move added 
	// Confirm the winner when 4 pieces make a row, column, or diagonal
