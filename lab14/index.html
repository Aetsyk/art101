            <h1>Lab 14 - Debugging Tools & Strategies</h1>

            <div>
                <h2>Challenge</h2>
                <p>The goal of this lab was to debug older labs and experiment with debugging methods.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h2>Problems</h2>
                <p>There weren't any bugs in my previous labs (at least not any I noticed), so I instead took the time to tidy my
                    site up, both in appearance and in code style, while applying some of my new knowledge. Task X took more
                    time, as I needed to come up with a function to demonstrate the debugger keyword.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h2>Results</h2>
                <p>As a result of my changes, each lab that uses JavaScript now has a link to the source code and each lab title
                    now uniformly uses a hyphen. I have also added new link sections to the main page. The result of my
                    experimentation with the debugger keyword is below. Open your browser's console and use the program to see.</p>
                <div id="debug-program">
                    <div id="debug-input">
                        <h3>Debugging Example: Rolling Dice</h3>
                        <label for="sideCount">How many sides?</label>
                        <input type="number" min="4" max="100" step="2" id="sideCount" name="sideCount" value="6">

                <h2>Debugging</h2>
                <p>Actually, it's not really debugging in my case.</p>

                    <img src="img/ART101_Lab14_homepageHTML_output.png" alt="New homepage">
                    <p>I added new sections to the homepage and put spaces between each element in the HTML. I put these spaces
                        between HTML blocks into every old lab that needed them to make the code more readable.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <img src="img/ART101_Lab14_L6_Honda.png" alt="Modified CSS for Lab 6">
                    <img src="img/ART101_Lab14_L6_Honda_output.png" alt="Honda image now even with the text section">
                    <p>In Lab 6, there was an image of a Honda Accord that sat next to the "challenge" block. I noticed it didn't
                        align perfectly with the block, so I slightly modified the CSS. Now it fits perfectly for computer screens.
                        There is probably a better way to program it that lets it perfectly adjust size, but I did what I could at
                        my current skill level.</p>
