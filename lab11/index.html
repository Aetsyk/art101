            <div>
                <h2>Challenge</h2>
                <p>The challenge of this lab is to experiment with JavaScript events to create a program that sorts a string (and
                    maybe make an anagram from it too).</p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h2>Problems</h2>
                <p>I didn't have any major problems during this lab, expecially since I was allowed to reuse code from a previous
                    lab. I keep forgetting to include the # when having jQuery pick out ids, and it takes me a bit to realize every
                    time. My biggest challenge was implimenting the features I came up with for Task X, as a lot of it had me doing
                    things that were unfamiliar to me, like clearing a section and evaluating input from multiple sources.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h2>Results</h2>
                <p>The result of my programming can be seen and interacted with below. Click "submit" to make an anagram from your
                    name, or hit "Sort Only" if you just want to sort the letters. Add a title to the second box and it will be
                    appended at the end of your anagram.</p>

                <div id="output"></div>
                <input type="text" id="user-name" placeholder="Input your name">
                <input type="text" id="user-title" placeholder="(Optional) Input a title">
                <button id="submit">Submit</button>
                <button id="clear">Clear</button>
                <button id="add-divider">Add Divider</button>
                <button id="sort-only">Sort Only</button>
