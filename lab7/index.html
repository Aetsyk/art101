                <h2>Challenge</h2>
                <p>The goal of this lab was to write functions that take user input and manipulate a string.</p>
            </div>

                <h2>Problems</h2>
                <p>I didn't have any problems with the main tasks for the lab. However, Task X gave me some trouble, as I didn't know
                    how to do much of what it asked in JavaScript before. Using what I knew from this class and from other programming
                    languages, I experimented with trying to make a program that could generate an anagram and output a div element.
                    After some trial and error, I got an output that I was satisfied with.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="minor-section">
                <h2>Results</h2>
                <p>Although I don't think I did it in the best way, I'm satisfied with the results. Take a look below.</p>
