				<h2>Challenge</h2>
				<p>The goal of this assignment was to experiment with DOM manipulation. This wasn't that challenging until Task X.</p>
			</div>

			<div>
				<h2>Problems</h2>
				<p>I had a few small problems writing the program, but I solved them pretty quickly. I thought for a bit on how
					I could add an input field to the program before realizing I could add it to the original function and have
					the user's message and computer message appear at the same time. This solution helped me figure out how I
					could make the messages look like text messages; I could add another class to the user's message that
					aligns it to the right. I was unsure how I could align them like that, but I found a way after messing with
					flexbox.</p>
